    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Kevin and I'm 29 years old.  Currently most of my free time is split up between working 
      full-time as a manager of train operations(MTO) and going to school.  I've been a MTO for about 
      5 years now, and its basically like being an air traffic controller, but for the railroad.  Outside 
      of that I like traveling, playing some video games, hiking, and various other activites.
    </p>

    <p>I am a computer science major.  One of the reasons I chose this major was because I've always enjoyed 
      working around computers, but it was also one of the few majors I could do around my hectic work schedule.  
      My job is a 24-hour manned position, so I work a lot of mornings, evenings, and nights.  My hours are all 
      over the place and constantly changing.  CS was one of the few majors that I could do that could work 
      around that.  But after taking a couple programming classes I've come to really enjoy it.  That feeling of 
      finally getting your code to work after spending hours working, debugging, and modifying is, for the lack 
      of a better word, fun.
    </p>

    <p>Currently my sights aren't very specific.  I'm looking for a way to break into the tech field.  I'd be 
      satisfied with taking a software related role for a railroad company to merge my skill sets together.
    </p>
