	Hi, I'm currently a CE student at FAU, going onto her senior year. I am proficient in C/C++ and hope to soon delve into Python, PHP, MySQL and HTML/CSS. Although that's probably a bit ambitious. Prior to persuing my CE degree, I had plans to persue  traditional art, which makes drawing an occassional hobby of mine. I'm currently working in an internship which is exposing me to testing and debugging software on embedded devices. I am interested in working closely with embedded systems to help develop the artificial limbs of the future.
