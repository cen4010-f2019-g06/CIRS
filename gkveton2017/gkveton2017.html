    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am a senior level Computer Science student at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, FL.
        I am looking forward to learning more about software development and engineering processes in this class project.
        Most of my programming experience has involved using C++, Python, and PHP. I have experience working with SQL and No-SQL databases as well.
        During the summer of this year, I had the opportunity to intern with Amazon Web Services, where I was exposed to real life development situations and cloud technology.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <P>In my free time I love to spend time skateboarding, DJing vinyl records, playing video games, or playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends.
        Over the last year and a half I have taken up learning video game development as a hobby and hope to have a small game finished by the time I graduate.
        I am looking forward to moving back to Denver, CO once I graduate from FAU so that I can hike, camp, and snowboard once again.
    </P>
