<div class="paragraphs"> My name is Kevin and I'm 29 years old.  Currently most of my free time is split up between working full-time as a manager of train operations(MTO) and going to school.  I've been a MTO for about 5 years now, and its basically like being an air traffic controller, but for the railroad.  Outside of that I like traveling, playing some video games, hiking, and various other activites.

I am a computer science major.  One of the reasons I chose this major was because I've always enjoyed working around computers, but it was also one of the few majors I could do around my hectic work schedule.  My job is a 24-hour manned position, so I work a lot of mornings, evenings, and nights.  My hours are all over the place and constantly changing.  CS was one of the few majors that I could do that could work around that.  But after taking a couple programming classes I've come to really enjoy it.  That feeling of finally getting your code to work after spending hours working, debugging, and modifying is, for the lack of a better word, fun.

<br>
Currently my sights aren't very specific.  I'm looking for a way to break into the tech field.  I'd be satisfied with taking a software related role for a railroad company to merge my skill sets together.
